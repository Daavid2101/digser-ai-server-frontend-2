This repository is publicly available to meet all obligations regarding used modules under GPL 2+ license. Feel free to use the code yourself. Please note that the code published here is only the frontend of our AI system - a suitable backend, which communicates via the correct HTTPS interfaces, is also required for use. The backend code will not be provided under the GPL 2+ license, as it is independent of the frontend.
